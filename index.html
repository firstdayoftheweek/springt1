                    <p>There were angry scenes at the UFC 296 news conference as Colby Covington made a shocking comment about Leon Edwards' late father ahead of their welterweight fight in Las Vegas. "I'm bringing you to the seventh layer of hell," Covington said to Edwards. "We'll say 'what's up' to your dad while we're there."

                    <p>Colby Covington’s shocking comment about Leon Edwards’ late father “being in hell” sparked an angry reaction from the Englishman at the UFC 296 news conference.
                        Edwards, the welterweight champion, will put his title on the line when he goes head-to-head with challenger Covington in the main event at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, live on TNT Sports Box Office on Saturday night.
                        There were heated scenes at Thursday’s pre-fight press conference after Covington – who was dressed as George Washington – goaded Edwards about his late father, who was murdered in London in 2004.</p>
